### Bio

Min Lu, PhD, is a Research Assistant Professor of Biostatistics in the Department of Public Health Sciences (DPHS) at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. She received her Doctoral degree in Biostatistics from the University of Miami in 2018 and joined the DPHS faculty in February 2019. Her primary work is centered around developing and integrating machine learning approaches to detect the causal relationship between treatments and outcome and facilitate personalized treatment decision. She has developed several statistical models with her PhD advisor, Dr. Hemant Ishwaran, for estimating individual treatment effects and obtaining individualized treatment rules that can accommodate continuous, binary, or survival outcomes. She also works on statistical inferences of Random Forest Variable Importance, which permit clinicians to connect informative features to patient outcomes and treatment effects. For example, she applied her methodological framework to ischemic cardiomyopathy and esophageal cancer with Dr. Ishwaran and surgeons from the Cleveland Clinic, with the purpose of facilitating precision therapy using observational dataset that identifies the specific treatment predicted to maximize survival for a patient. Her other areas of interest include developing and applying random forest models for interaction detection for cancer genomics data and microbiology data from patients with infectious eye diseases. Another infectious disease of her interest is COVID-19: since 2020, she has published two papers that deveopled data-driven compartmental models to evaluate containment strategies and estimate the effect of vaccination.
